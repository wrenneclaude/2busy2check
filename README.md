2busy2check is a short python app made to show the priority queue status of the 2b2t server.
It uses LolRiTTeR's 2b2t api (https://api.2b2t.dev) and has a simple resizeable GUI.

Features:
You can open the main.py file without building it

If you'd like the code to run on every Windows startup, simply copy the .bat file shortcut into your startup folder
(the startup folder can be found by pressing winkey+r and typing "shell:startup")
The .bat file will then run the main.py code on every startup
